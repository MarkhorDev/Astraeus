# Astraeus

Astraeus is a low-resoltuion asteroid clone made in Godot. This was my first game project in this engine (switched from Unity) so I wanted to keep it really simple. I didn't intend on releasing this originally but I turned out being much happier with the gameplay so decided to turn it into a more finished product.

The game can be played [here](https://zombee8424.itch.io/astraeus) on itch.io.
